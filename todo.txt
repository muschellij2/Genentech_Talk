Things to do:
1) Volume plot - show for RF - done
2) Put Dice results in there - done
3) Get 1 person in test set with very low lesion, other with average, other with high
4) Conclusions about biomarker - done
5) Talk about Brain Stem lesions - done
6) Future directions (GM quality, black holes, lesion trajectory)
